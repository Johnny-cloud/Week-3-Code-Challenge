## About the project

It is a web application that allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the
theater. The Films today section displays a list of currently available movies. The user can then select from the list of movies and if the tickets are availble they can make the purchase.
When the user clicks on the purchase ticket button, the available tickets section updates and number of tickets decreases.
